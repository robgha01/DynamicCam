# DynamicCam Backport for 3.3.5
DynamicCam automates camera transitions (and settings) between the many different 'situations' that your character can find themselves in.

Examples:
* Zoom in when indoors
* Zoom out while mounted
* Zoom in and rotate while teleporting/hearthing (and hide the UI!)
* Set your zoom to a particular value while fishing
